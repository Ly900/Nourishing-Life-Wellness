      An individualized treatment plan is one of the biggest differences between Western and Eastern medicine.  Acupuncture is an important treatment modality in Eastern medicine that has been around for thousands of years. The practice of acupuncture involves a varying set of procedures used to stimulate specific points on the body by the insertion of needles.  The technique involves penetrating the skin with thin filiform needles that are manipulated manually by the practitionerâ€™s hands or by electric stimulation.  The needles vary in gauge and length and are dependent on the treatment and technique used.

      The purpose of inserting needles into specific points is to ensure proper  energy flow (also known as qi) on and between the different meridans of the body.  Activating the points help remove obstructions and stagnation as well as expel pathogenic factors.

      In Chinese medicine, health is achieved through the harmonious  balance of yin and yang inside the body.  Illness arises when this balance is disrupted.  In every treatment, the practitioner will aim to balance the dynamic of yin and yang by either dispersing the excess or tonifying the deficiency.  The balance could take multiple visits.  However, each visit builds on all prior treatments so it is important to discuss and maintain a consistent schedule for treatments to hold.
