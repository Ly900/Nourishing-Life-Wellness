      Inside of the treatment room, Khanh applies deep listening and allows space for her patients to talk.  She believes that before healing begins, the heart has to be open.  In Chinese medicine, the Heart opens to the tongue, allowing for speech and expression.  When the Heart is blocked, the patientâ€™s individuality cannot thrive.  Khanh takes time to check in with the patient on the mind and spirit level before starting with the needle treatment.  For Khanh, Mind/Body/Spirit are not separate and should not be treated separately.
